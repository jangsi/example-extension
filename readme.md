Includes the Chrome extension and a test web page.

Run `python3 server.py` in the [test](test) directory to run a web server to access [index.html](test/index.html)
 - You can generate a key/cert with: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365`
 - If Chrome complains about an invalid cert, you can type `thisisunsafe` on that page and Chrome will let you proceed
 - go to https://localhost:4443/index.html

Install the Chrome extension
 - Go to chrome://extensions and enable Developer mode.
 - Load unpacked and select the folder containing this [manifest.json](manifest.json)

Note the extension ID in the webpage at [index.js](test/index.js). This ID is generated by Chrome when you install a local extension so replace this string with the ID from the chrome://extensions page.

To get it working with your own website, update the `externally_connectable` setting in [manifest.json](manifest.json) so that your page can communicate with the extension.
